# keybase-export
This project is a fork of [kbe](https://git.zapashcanon.fr/zapashcanon/kbe) by [Zapashcanon](https://git.zapashcanon.fr/zapashcanon).

I have modified the project to make it more compatible with my needs, allowing for ease of use on Windows 11 in the Windows Terminal.

## Installation
Simply clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/ajmeese7/keybase-export` and you are ready to go!

## Usage
1. Ensure that you have Python 3 installed
2. Ensure that you have the [keybase](https://keybase.io/) CLI installed
3. `py ./export_keybase.py yourusername,theirusername`
